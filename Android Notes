Finding view by id
Val/var name = findviewbyid<viewtype>(R.id.viewID)
Set on click listner on buttons
Var buton=findviewbyid<Button>(R.id.button1)
buton.setOnClickListener({/*we have to write the onclick logic here*/})

Using the EditText/entry
>>getting colour from id and setting it to text view using ContextCompat
text.setTextColor(ContextCompat.getColor(this,R.color.red))
>> getting the text form entry
var s=””
s=textviewname.text.toString()
>> setting the text
Textviewname.text=”gaurav”
>> clearing the text
Textviewname.text.clear()

Starting a new activity

>>To start a new activity we have to use an object called Intent, and  this object can be stored in a variable of can be directlu passed into startActivity() function to start new activity.

startActivity(Intent(this/this@currentActivvityName, newactivityname::class.java)

>> by storing it into a variable we can pass  extra data to the next activity as shown below

var intt=Intent(this , newactivityname::class.java)
intt.putExtra(“the reference of the passed value”,the_passed_value)
startActicity(intt)  //passing the intent into this function

>> to fetch the passed input on the new activity we write

var st=intent.getStringExtra(“name_of_the_data”)  //here intent is the value of the Activity not the passed variable name

Making a objects visible and invisible
>> we have to import the following things

import android.view.View.INVISIBLE
import android.view.View.VISIBLE
>>  to set the visibility we write
viewname.visibility=VISIBLE/INVISIBLE
Difference between Interface and Abstract Class
Kotlin interfaces are similar to abstract classes. However, interfaces cannot store state whereas abstract classes can. Meaning, interface may have property but it needs to be abstract or has to provide accessor implementations. Whereas, it's not mandatory for property of an abstract class to be abstract.
the choice between using an abstract class or an interface in Kotlin depends on your design requirements. If you need to provide some common implementation along with abstract methods, you might use an abstract class. If you want to define a contract without any implementation details, interfaces are more appropriate, especially when you need to support multiple inheritance of behavior.

Creating Log and reading them

>> this function is called when a activity returns from paused to resume state 
override fun onResume() {
    super.onResume()
    Log.i("mytag","MainActivity: on resume")
}


>> when an activity is killed then after restart this function is called
override fun onRestart() {
    super.onRestart()
    Log.i("mytag","MainActivity: on restart")

}


>> this function is called on starting of the activity at very first time
override fun onStart() {
    super.onStart()
    Log.i("mytag","MainActivity: on start")
}

>> this is called when an activity is stopped for certain time
override fun onStop() {
    super.onStop()
    Log.i("mytag","MainActivity: on stop")
}

>> this function is called when an activity is killed
override fun onDestroy() {
    super.onDestroy()
    Log.i("mytag","MainActivity: on destroy")
}


 


The logs printed by the avobe functions
To view thw logs we have to write the tag where “mytag” is written in the avobe picture after opening thee logcat
 




The basics of Activity Lifecycle

We use lateinit in kotlin when we donot want to initialize a variable instantly it will not give error in thee code
lateinit var name:String
Using SharedPreferences to store small amount of data

Creating shared preference with NAME and MODE(MODE_PRIVATE means this is accessible to current application only) 
var sp=getSharedPreferences("mysp", MODE_PRIVATE)

Now we create a Editor to edit the sp(shared preferences)
var editor=sp.edit()

We can add values like this 
editor.apply({
    putString("name","Gaurav")
    putInt("age",21)
    commit() //commit is very important
})

And also like this
editor.putString("class","AIML")
editor.apply()  // apply is very important
editor.commit() //commit is very important

Using in current activity
entry1.setText(sp.getString("name","noname"))
entry2.setText(sp.getInt("age",0).toString()+sp.getString("class","noclass"))

Creating instance of Sharedpreferences in new Activity is similar as creating a new one
val sp = getSharedPreferences("mysp", MODE_PRIVATE)

Here we have to pass two arguments , the name of the data we want and the default value id we donot get the data
sp.getString("name","Noname")

When we try to add a data with a name which exist previously ,, then the previous data gets updated with thee new data


To add elevation to any view ..
We just need to add a empty blank background and add elevation to the view in the xml code …. Elevation will be applied
android:elevation="40dp"
android:padding="10dp"


>>to add custom colour to shadow we use
android:outlineSpotShadowColor="@color/red"

To give a click effect on buttons 
We have to design a animation resource file 
<set xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <scale
        android:fromXScale="1.0"
        android:fromYScale="1.0"
        android:toXScale="0.85"
        android:toYScale="0.85"
        android:duration="300"
        android:pivotX="50%"
        android:pivotY="50%" />
    <alpha
        android:fromAlpha="1.0"
        android:toAlpha="0.7"
        android:duration="300" />
</set>

And make its object in the main activity file of kotlin and start the animation like this 
val anim =AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(this,R.drawable.effect)
text.startAnimation(anim)

The animation will be started soon

To give the ripple effect to the Views

MUSIC Handling in kotlin  (MyApplication4)

>> create a basic UI of a music app having elements 
FloatingActionButton(playpause,stop), ImageView, TextView(played,left)
And SeekBar

>> initializing the variables
private lateinit var sound:MediaPlayer
private lateinit var handler:Handler
private lateinit var tplayed:TextView
private lateinit var tleft:TextView
private lateinit var runnable: Runnable
private lateinit var seekbar: SeekBar



>>MediaPlayer is used to create thee instance of music file which has to be played
sound= MediaPlayer.create(this,R.raw.music)

>> Handler I used to call a thread to update seekbar again and again
handler=Handler(Looper.getMainLooper())


>> Runnable is a thread which update the seekbar   
Here we also update the text fields with time stamps
runnable= Runnable {
    tplayed.text="00:"+(sound.currentPosition/1000).toString()
    tleft.text="00:"+((sound.duration-sound.currentPosition)/1000).toString()
    seekbar.progress=sound.currentPosition
    handler.postDelayed(runnable,15)
}
handler.postDelayed(runnable,15)


>> to play sound  sound.start()  ,,,, to  pause sound  sound.pause()
To stop sound sound.stop() //this method kills the sound object so we have to reinitialize it   
>> sound.isPlaying() return true if music is being played  else false
playpause.setOnClickListener({
    if (sound.isPlaying()){
        sound.pause()
        playpause.setImageResource(R.drawable.img_play)
    }
    else{
        playpause.setImageResource(R.drawable.img_pause)
        
        sound.start()
    }
})

>> implementing seekbarChangeListner 
Whenever somebody will move the seekbar then the music will be automatically adjusted by help of code inside OnProgressChanged

seekbar.setOnSeekBarChangeListener(object : OnSeekBarChangeListener {
    override fun onProgressChanged(skbar: SeekBar?, progress: Int, fromuser: Boolean) {
    if (fromuser) sound.seekTo(progress)
    }
    override fun onStartTrackingTouch(skbar: SeekBar?) {
    }
    override fun onStopTrackingTouch(skbar: SeekBar?) {
    }
})


>> implementing the stop button
stop.setOnClickListener({
    sound.stop()
    playpause.setImageResource(R.drawable.img_play)
    sound=MediaPlayer.create(this,R.raw.music)
    handler.removeCallbacks(runnable)
    seekbar.progress=0
})


     
 









 Video management in android App
>> Add a video view to the xml layout
>> find the id    video = findViewById<VideoView>(R.id.videoView)
>> Create a media controller to control play/pause/seek and set it on the videoview by help of   setAnchorView()
>> Now we have to open the device explorer to find the desired video
    Here startForResult is a object of ActivityResultLauncher class which is used to launch a activity and retrieve required data from it
The lambda function is a callback After the launched activity returns the correct output 
And a  variable “res” is created of type ActivityResult (res:ActivityResult -> …) which stores the returned data from the launched activity ,
Then the data from thee returned result is stored in a intent by using (res.data)
Then we get the data from the data Intent by using (data.data)
The “let” function is used to run a block  of code if the data in non null  
Here “uri” is a variable which stores the value of data.data for further use in the block of the code
data.data.let {uri->…} 
val intent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_GET_CONTENT)
intent.type = "video/*" // Filter for video files
intent.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_OPENABLE)
startForResult.launch(intent)


private val startForResult =
    registerForActivityResult(ActivityResultContracts.StartActivityForResult()) { res: ActivityResult ->
        if (res.resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
            val data: Intent? = res.data
            data?.data?.let { uri ->
                var inte=Intent(this@MainActivity,VideoActivity::class.java)
                inte.putExtra("uri",uri)
                startActivity(inte)
            }
        }
    }


 
>> Then the uri  is passed in an intent and then the other activity of our need
>>To retrieve the uri in thee next activity we catch the passed intent and retrieve the data from the passed intent and set the uri to thee video view
val inte:Uri?=intent.getParcelableExtra("uri")
if (inte!=null){
    video.setVideoURI(inte)
}

>> and  then we play thee video by calling 
video.start()

>> the video have many attributes  like …  we  can use them and many more similarly li audio
video.start()
video.resume()
video.pause()
video.seekTo()
video.currentPosition
video.duration
video.isPlaying 
etc.
